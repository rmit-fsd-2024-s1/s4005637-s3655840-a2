    <h1>What is a Potato Grow Bag?</h1>
<p>
A potato grow bag is a durable, breathable bag that allows air to circulate throughout the root system. They provide a fantastic space-saving option to grow seed potatoes or other deep-rooted vegetables.
<br></br><br></br>
Potato planter bags that you buy are typically made from hard-wearing polyethylene. They often have a resealable window, for harvesting new potatoes, towards the bottom of the container. 
<br></br><br></br>
They are normally around 40-50 cm high and 35 cm in diameter. These durable bags can be reused over several years. You can also make your own potato grow bags.
<br></br><br></br>
</p>
<h2>Do Potato Grow Bags Work?</h2>
<p>
Absolutely. By following the guide below you’ll soon be producing delicious home-grown potatoes. Potatoes do well in containers. You don’t need a large veggie patch to grow them, and they can thrive in potato grow bags. 
<br></br><br></br>
Traditionally, when growing potatoes in a veggie patch, gardeners ‘hill’ their plants. This involves periodically covering their potato plants with additional fresh soil as they grow. Forming a hill protects the tubers from light and supports the plant. 
<br></br><br></br>
You’ll be following a similar process in the potato grow bag by adding layers of soil as the plant grows. The more you cover the tubers, the more roots are sent out through the soil mix and the larger the harvest. 
</p>

<h2>How many potatoes can you grow in a grow bag? </h2>
<p>
Depending on the size of your container and the size of the seed potatoes, a potato planter bag will normally hold about 3-5 seed potatoes. Don’t be tempted to add more because they will be competing for nutrients, and you’ll end up with a similar or worse harvest. 
<br></br><br></br>
Again, depending on the variety of potatoes planted and when you harvest them, you should expect about 2-3 kgs of spuds per seed potato planted.

<p>
Planting and growing potatoes in a bag of soil is easy. The soil mix layering approach is a no-fuss method of growing potatoes in a container. It involves some basic setup and then semi-regular topping up of the soil mixture, as the plant grows, until reaching the top of the grow bag. You can then start harvesting a couple of weeks after the potato plant flowers. 
</p>
<h2>Best Soil for Potatoes in Bags</h2>
<p>When using a potato bag, it is important to use good quality soil. Potatoes love rich soil with lots of organic matter. You can use potting mix or compost, although compost will produce better results. The best combination is some fresh compost, well-rotted animal manure and some straw. </p>

<p>
While potatoes will adapt to light or heavy soils, good drainage is essential. The soil should be well-draining to prevent the tubers from rotting. Adding the straw will help to ensure you have the necessary water
</p>
<h2>How long does it take to grow potatoes in a grow bag? </h2>
<p>Your spuds will be ready to harvest a couple of weeks after the plant flowers. Depending on how mature you want your potatoes, they will typically be ready between two and four months after planting.
