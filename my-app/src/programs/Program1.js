    <h1>Growing Vegetables at Home</h1>
    <h2>Consistent emergence & growth to maximise the imporovement of the crop.</h2>
    <p>
    Growing lettuce and other leafy greens is as simple as it gets. The seeds are uncomplicated little survivors – they can even make it through a light frost.
<br></br><br></br>
They don’t need a ton of sun, either. Give each seed a few inches to grow (especially if you’re planting more solid-headed breeds), and bury about ½ inch below the soil’s surface.
<br></br><br></br>
The soil should be moist but not overly damp. You’ll need to check for bugs, but there’s really nothing else to it – just clip the leaves (they come up quickly!), wash and enjoy.
The plants should yield throughout the season so stock up on your salad dressings!

  <h1>Easiest Vegetables to Grow for Beginners</h1>
  <p>You don’t need years of experience (or any experience for that matter!) to learn how to grow vegetables. Here are some of the easiest vegetables to grow in your backyard:</p>
   <h2>Leafy Greens</h2>

 <h2>Tomatoes</h2>

 <p>Growing your own tomato garden is relatively easy. They can be used to create soups, sauces or simple sandwich toppings.To grow them, you need only a small amount of space and some nice, nutritious soil. Buy a baby plant, pop it in the ground and water regularly. That’s it.
 <br></br><br></br>
Check for bugs and discard any infested parts of your plants. After a couple of weeks, they should begin to sprout and over time they should grow into full-grown tomato trees.
<br></br><br></br>
Expect to fill your countertops with these juicy reds by the end of the season. You can learn more about growing your own tomatoes at home by watching the tutorial below.

<h2>Beets</h2>

<p>
Stick beets in the ground about ½ inch deep and 1-2 inches apart when the soil is cool, damp and nutritious. Thinning may be necessary as some seeds yield more than one seedling.
<br></br><br></br>
Be careful when tackling this, however, as beets are easily disturbed by actions toward neighboring plants (plucking one from the ground, for example, may entirely expose the beet right next to it).
<br></br><br></br>
Despite this, beets are simple to grow. Among their many appealing qualities is their ability to tough it out in the cold. They can continue to grow in frosty weather, in fact. And they taste great, too!
